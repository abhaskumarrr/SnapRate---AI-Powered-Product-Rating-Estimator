# SnapRate – AI-Powered Product Rating Estimator
SnapRate is a lightweight, modular AI tool that predicts a product's potential customer rating (1–5 stars) using only a product image and title as input. It simulates a first-impression-based rating similar to what users subconsciously do while browsing products online. The tool is designed to be mobile-first, responsive, and AI-integrated, with both web and mobile support in mind.  SnapRate is built for solo e-commerce sellers, designers, and developers who want to evaluate how appealing their product appears before it's listed or advertised.
