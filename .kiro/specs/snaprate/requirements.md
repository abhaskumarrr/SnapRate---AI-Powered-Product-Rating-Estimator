# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SnapRate is a lightweight, modular AI tool designed to predict a product's potential customer rating (1-5 stars) using only a product image and title as input. The application simulates the first-impression-based rating that customers subconsciously make while browsing products online. SnapRate is built for solo e-commerce sellers, designers, and developers who want to evaluate how appealing their product appears before it's listed or advertised. The tool is designed to be mobile-first, responsive, and AI-integrated, with both web and mobile support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Input Handling

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want to upload product images through multiple methods, so that I can flexibly evaluate products regardless of where the images are stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to capture an image using a mobile device camera.
2. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to upload an image from local storage.
3. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to input an image URL.
4. WHEN an image is provided through any input method THEN the system SHALL validate the image format and size.
5. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the image to the user.
6. WHEN an invalid image is provided THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 2: Product Title Input

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want to enter a product title along with the image, so that the AI can evaluate both visual and textual aspects of my product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has uploaded an image THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for entering the product title.
2. WHEN a user submits a product title THEN the system SHALL validate that the title is not empty.
3. WHEN a user submits a product title THEN the system SHALL validate that the title does not exceed a reasonable character limit.
4. WHEN an invalid title is provided THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 3: Rating Prediction

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want to receive an AI-generated rating prediction for my product, so that I can understand how appealing my product appears to potential customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits both a valid image and title THEN the system SHALL process the inputs and generate a rating prediction.
2. WHEN the system generates a rating prediction THEN the system SHALL display a star rating on a scale of 1-5 (with decimal precision).
3. WHEN the system generates a rating prediction THEN the system SHALL display a confidence score as a percentage.
4. WHEN the system generates a rating prediction THEN the system SHALL provide a textual explanation of the rating factors.
5. WHEN the system is processing the prediction THEN the system SHALL display a loading animation to indicate processing.
6. IF the prediction process fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly across different devices, so that I can use it on my preferred device without limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface.
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on a desktop device THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-optimized interface.
3. WHEN a user rotates their mobile device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly.
4. WHEN a user resizes their browser window THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and visual integrity.
5. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL support PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality.

### Requirement 5: Backend API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured API for the rating prediction service, so that the frontend can communicate efficiently with the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends a request to the API THEN the system SHALL accept multipart/form-data containing the image and title.
2. WHEN the API receives a valid request THEN the system SHALL process the image and title to generate a prediction.
3. WHEN the API generates a prediction THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON response with rating, confidence, and explanation.
4. WHEN the API is queried for health status THEN the system SHALL return appropriate health information.
5. WHEN the API encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages.
6. WHEN the frontend communicates with the API THEN the system SHALL handle CORS appropriately.

### Requirement 6: AI Prediction Logic

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate and insightful rating predictions, so that I can make informed decisions about my product listings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes an image THEN the system SHALL extract relevant visual features for prediction.
2. WHEN the system processes a title THEN the system SHALL analyze textual features for prediction.
3. WHEN the system has extracted features THEN the system SHALL combine them to generate a comprehensive rating.
4. IF the system is in demo/MVP mode THEN the system SHALL use rule-based heuristics to simulate AI behavior.
5. IF the system is in AI mode THEN the system SHALL use pre-trained models for more accurate predictions.
6. WHEN the system generates a prediction THEN the system SHALL provide a human-readable explanation of the factors influencing the rating.

### Requirement 7: Modularity and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be modular and extensible, so that it can be enhanced with new features and AI models in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the system THEN the system SHALL have decoupled frontend and backend components.
2. WHEN implementing the AI logic THEN the system SHALL use a modular approach that allows for easy model swapping.
3. WHEN designing the architecture THEN the system SHALL support future integration with more advanced AI models.
4. WHEN implementing the system THEN the system SHALL follow best practices for code organization and structure.
5. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL use versioning to support future enhancements.

### Requirement 8: Security and Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be secure and reliably deployed, so that I can trust it with my product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the frontend THEN the system SHALL be compatible with modern hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
2. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL be deployable on cloud platforms or as a containerized application.
3. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures.
4. WHEN the API receives requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
5. WHEN implementing the system THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for web applications.
